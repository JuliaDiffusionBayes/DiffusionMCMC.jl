# The underlying structure
*****
[DiffusionMCMC.jl](https://juliadiffusionbayes.github.io/DiffusionMCMC.jl/dev/) is at its core an extension of [ExtensibleMCMC.jl](https://juliadiffusionbayes.github.io/ExtensibleMCMC.jl/dev/). Consequently, the way of interacting with the package follows closely how it was presented in [here](https://juliadiffusionbayes.github.io/ExtensibleMCMC.jl/dev/get_started/basic_use/). In particular, the list of parameter updates remains unchanged, it is merely extended with additional steps pertinent to imputation of the paths.
