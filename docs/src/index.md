# DiffusionMCMC.jl
Bayesian inference for diffusion processes via MCMC sampling. It's an extension of [ExtensibleMCMC.jl](https://juliadiffusionbayes.github.io/ExtensibleMCMC.jl/dev/) to diffusion processes.

All algorithms provided in [ExtensibleMCMC.jl](https://juliadiffusionbayes.github.io/ExtensibleMCMC.jl/dev/) work here as well and do inference for diffusions.
